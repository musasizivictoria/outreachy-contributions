# Drug Absorption Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict drug absorption using the Caco2_Wang dataset from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and validates it on recent ChEMBL data. Our goal is to create a robust binary classifier that predicts whether a drug compound will have high or low permeability through the Caco2 cell membrane, with proven generalization to unseen data.

### Why This Dataset Matters
The Caco2_Wang dataset is particularly valuable for drug discovery because:
1. It provides experimental measurements from Caco2 cells, which are derived from human colorectal adenocarcinoma and serve as a well-established model for intestinal absorption
2. The data represents actual permeability measurements in cm/s, making it directly relevant to drug development
3. The dataset is well-balanced (51.6% low permeability vs 48.4% high permeability) and of moderate size (910 compounds), making it suitable for machine learning

## Understanding the Data

### Experimental Background
- **Original Task Type**: Regression (predicting exact permeability values)
- **Measurement**: Permeability through Caco2 cell monolayers (human intestinal model)
- **Units**: Centimeters per second (cm/s)
- **Value Range**: 1.74 × 10⁻⁸ to 3.09 × 10⁻⁴ cm/s

### Conversion to Binary Classification
While the Caco2_Wang dataset originally provides continuous permeability values (regression task), I converted it to a binary classification problem using industry-standard thresholds:

- **Cutoff Value**: 8 × 10⁻⁶ cm/s (based on FDA guidelines and literature)
- **Binary Labels**:
  - High Permeability (1): ≥ 8 × 10⁻⁶ cm/s
  - Low Permeability (0): < 8 × 10⁻⁶ cm/s

**Rationale for Conversion**:
1. Binary classification models are often more robust and easier to validate
2. The cutoff value (8 × 10⁻⁶ cm/s) is well-established in pharmaceutical research
3. In drug discovery, the binary high/low permeability classification is often more actionable than exact values

### Dataset Composition
- **Total Size**: 910 compounds
- **Class Balance**: Near-perfect (51.6% low, 48.4% high permeability)
- **Data Splits**:
  - Training: 637 compounds (51.6% low, 48.4% high)
  - Validation: 91 compounds (46.2% low, 53.8% high)
  - Test: 182 compounds (54.4% low, 45.6% high)

### Molecular Properties
- **Input Format**: SMILES strings (molecular structure)
- **Complexity**: Average SMILES length ~60 characters
- **Chemistry**: Primarily organic compounds
  - Carbon (~57%)
  - Oxygen (~20%)
  - Nitrogen (~10%)
  - Hydrogen (~9%)
  - Other elements (~4%)

### 3. Molecular Featurization

#### Implementation Journey

1. **Initial Approach - Uni-Mol Model**
   - I originally planned to use Ersilia's Uni-Mol model (eos39co) for its advantages:
     - 3D molecular information capture
     - Large-scale training (>200M conformations)
     - SE(3) equivariant architecture
   - Encountered challenges:
     - Docker Hub connectivity issues (TLS handshake timeout)
     - Internal server errors during model fetch
     - Difficulties with local model initialization

     The logs can be found at `data/visualizations/featurization.log`. This may not appear as it may be .gitkept

     The challenges have been addressed by:
     - Docker prunning to alow for more resources to the model fetch and run
     - Addressed the permission issues by escalating the privileges

   ```bash
   # Generate molecular features
   python scripts/featurize_data_unimol.py
   ```
     The model was successfully loaded and the features were generated. as you may find the script in `scripts/featurize_data_unimol.py`.

     The features were saved in the `data/features_unimol` directory.

     The statistics of the features can be found in `data/features_unimol/featurization_stats.json`.

    
2. **Alternative Solution - Morgan Fingerprints**
   - Switched to RDKit's Morgan fingerprints (ECFP4) because:
     - No external dependencies (built into RDKit)
     - Fast computation (910 molecules in ~10 seconds)
     - Well-established in drug discovery
     - High success rate in feature generation

```bash
# Generate molecular features
python scripts/featurize_data.py
```

This script performs several key tasks:
1. **Data Loading**: Reads SMILES strings from each dataset split
2. **Feature Generation**: Creates 2048-bit Morgan fingerprints
3. **Validation**: Checks feature quality and computes statistics
4. **Visualization**: Creates PCA plots to visualize chemical space
5. **Error Handling**: Tracks and reports any failed molecules

#### Feature Analysis

1. **Feature Properties**
   - Dimensionality: 2048 binary bits per molecule
   - Sparsity: ~96.7-96.9% of bits are zero
   - Consistent statistics across splits:
     - Active bits: 3.1-3.3% per molecule
     - Most common substructures appear in 75-95% of molecules
     - Many bits (substructures) never appear
   - No NaN or infinite values

2. **Chemical Space Analysis**
   - PCA visualization:
     - Low variance explained (3.3-5.2% for first 2 PCs)
     - Suggests highly complex chemical space
   - Molecular similarity:
     - Average Tanimoto similarity: 0.149-0.163
     - Similar values within permeability classes
     - Indicates diverse chemical space

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Processing speed: ~400-600 molecules/second
   - Memory efficiency: <1GB RAM usage
   - Success rate: 100% (910/910 molecules)
   - No failed SMILES parsing

4. **Advantages for ML**
   - Fixed-length representation
   - Interpretable bits (each represents a substructure)
   - Sparse binary format (memory efficient)
   - Well-suited for many ML algorithms

Just a summary of the  XGBoost arch and performance analysis

#### XGBoost Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Learning Rate | 0.01 | Slower, more robust learning |
| Max Depth | 6 | Control tree complexity |
| Subsample | 0.8 | Prevent overfitting |
| Early Stopping | 50 rounds | Optimal model selection |
| Tree Method | Histogram | Faster training on GPU/CPU |


#### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Train | Validation | Test |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| Accuracy | 97.8% | 72.5% | 73.6% |
| Precision | 98.0% | 76.1% | 70.1% |
| Recall | 97.4% | 71.4% | 73.5% |
| F1-Score | 97.7% | 73.7% | 71.8% |
| ROC-AUC | 99.8% | 79.6% | 80.3% |


And interesting is the  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve 

its plotted for each data split (train/valid/test) and saved in `data/visualizations_unimol/`.

   *Technical Details*
   | Component | Description |
   |-----------|-------------|
   | X-axis | False Positive Rate (FPR = FP/(FP+TN)) |
   | Y-axis | True Positive Rate (TPR = TP/(TP+FN)) |
   | Diagonal | Random classifier baseline (AUC = 0.5) |
   | AUC Score | Area Under Curve (0.803 on test set) |

generally Test AUC of 0.803 shows strong predictive power

Note:

Even with a Test accuracy of 73.6%, there looks to be some  train-test accuracy gap which could be skeptically and evidence of overfitting. or may be we need more robust architecture optimization or even stronger regularisation.

- `Permeability`: Actual permeability in cm/s (computed as 10^Y)
- `Binary`: Classification label (0: low, 1: high permeability)

### SMILES Format
SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings in the dataset:
- Represent molecular structure in text format
- Average length: ~60 characters
- Example: `CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(O)C=C1` (Acetaminophen/Paracetamol)
- Most common elements: C, O, N, H (>95% of all atoms)

### Data Quality
1. **Class Balance**
   - Overall: 51.6% low / 48.4% high permeability
   - Training: 51.6% / 48.4%
   - Validation: 46.2% / 53.8%
   - Test: 54.4% / 45.6%

2. **Value Distribution**
   - Range: 1.74 × 10⁻⁸ to 3.09 × 10⁻⁴ cm/s
   - Median: 7.39 × 10⁻⁶ cm/s (close to cutoff)
   - Distribution: See `data/permeability_distribution.png`

Experimenting with morgan descriptor, surprisingly i get a summary of results as;

*Morgan Fingerprint Model*

| Metric | Train | Validation | Test |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| Accuracy | 87.6% | 74.7% | 74.7% |
| Precision | 85.2% | 73.2% | 71.3% |
| Recall | 89.9% | 83.7% | 74.7% |
| F1-Score | 87.5% | 78.1% | 72.9% |
| ROC-AUC | 95.2% | 80.4% | 83.9% |

ROC-AUC of 83.9% on the TDC test set  is quite competitive, thou still having a siginificant gap train-test gap(95.2%  to 83.9%   )

So just to give us a brief of overall performace vs benchmark

*Test Set Performance*
   | Model | ROC-AUC | Notes |
   |-------|----------|-------|
   | Morgan (Ours) | 0.839 | Traditional fingerprints |
   | Uni-Mol (Ours) | 0.803 | Deep learning embeddings |
   | Wang et al. [1] | 0.872 | Boosting + NSGA-II |
   | TDC Baseline | 0.850 | AttentiveFP |

Our Morgan model achieves competitive but not SOTA performance
   - Gap of ~3.3% from best published results
   - Uni-Mol underperforms despite modern architecture
   - Both models show significant train-test gap

## TESTING THE MODEL ON UNSEEN DATA

I generated fingerprints for 6603 compounds from ChEMBL
Validation Results:

Number of compounds: 6603

ROC-AUC: 0.575

This is very uncertain, but I realised the challengecam  from the dataset is imbalanced:

1319 compounds (20%) with label 0 (low permeability)
5284 compounds (80%) with label 1 (high permeability) meaning the model is not able to make strong predictions on this external dataset.

Loooking at how best I can ind out the cause,  I checked the chemical space , and it looked closely similar as those in our training set, but I suggest there could be diference in the experimental condtions or assays  and also model limitations in capturing the structure-permeability relationship.

![alt text](image.png)
![alt text](image-1.png)

from these visualizations, there could have been a bit highly imbalanced especially on the low and high permeability

even when i balanced the dataset, i still get a low ROC-AUC of 0.586  just slightl better but still not good.

So i did futher validation as bellow;


### Validation Data (ChEMBL)
- **Source**: ChEMBL database version 35 (2022-2024)
- **Compounds**: 1,045 recent measurements
- **Assay Types**: 
  - Type A (Standard Caco2): 1,035 compounds
  - Type B (Modified): 10 compounds
- **Year Distribution**:
  - 2022: 563 compounds
  - 2023: 464 compounds
  - 2024: 18 compounds

### Binary Classification Task
We converted the continuous permeability values to a binary classification problem using industry-standard thresholds:

- **Cutoff Value**: 8 × 10⁻⁶ cm/s (based on FDA guidelines and literature)
- **Binary Labels**:
  - High Permeability (1): ≥ 8 × 10⁻⁶ cm/s
  - Low Permeability (0): < 8 × 10⁻⁶ cm/s

Well balanced: 46.7% high permeability, 53.3% low permeability

Model Performance:

Accuracy: 0.652
ROC-AUC: 0.709
F1-score: 0.652

You can find more details below;

**Rationale**:
1. Binary classification models are often more robust and easier to validate
2. The cutoff value is well-established in pharmaceutical research
3. Binary high/low permeability classification is often more actionable than exact values
